## Project Description

For my final project in the course Information Visualization, I used Tableau to visualize factors that cause a U.S. to have a young age of first marriage. There were four different data sets used for this analysis. The main data set came from prb.org and contains data on the median age of first marriage of women in the U.S. There were two different time periods in this data set: 2006-2010 and 2015-2019.

The other three data sets were used to look at potential factors in predicting/influencing the age of first marriage in each state. These include: a data set on high school graduation rates in 2019-2020 from US News, poverty rates in each state from 2019 from chronicl.com, and data on popular vote in the 2020 presidential election from cookpolitical.com. 

## Conclusions from Analysis 
States with a young median age of first marriage for women tend to have:
- Low state population size
- A central location in the U.S. 
- High rates of poverty 
- A political affiliation closest to Republican 
*No conclusions could be made based on high school graduation rate*
